The following JSON-formatted examples illustrate a possible schema for SpatialSeed’s SPF grounding layer. Each entry lists an instrument category, role, and optionally genre, along with its spatial coordinates in both polar (azimuth, elevation, distance) and Cartesian (x, y, z) form. License metadata (type, source URL/name, year, attribution, restrictions) is included per entry. All coordinate values are drawn from cited sources for the given instrument placement.
